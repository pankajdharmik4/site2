            title: "Consultation and 3D Planning",
            description: "During the initial visit, your dentist evaluates your oral and systemic health, reviews X-rays and 3D scans, and develops a tailored treatment plan. This stage identifies the optimal placement site and ensures your bone and gum tissue are ready for implants. Using this 3D imaging the dentist will then plan the surgery digitally and create a 3D printed template for use during the surgery."

            title: "Implant Placement Surgery",
            description: "Under local anesthesia (and sedation if required), the dentist, guided by the surgical template safely inserts a titanium implant post into the jawbone. This post acts as an artificial tooth root, providing a stable foundation for the replacement tooth. This process is painless after the local anaesthetic takes effect and post operative healing is usually more comfortable than patients were expecting."

            question: "What are dental implants, and how do they work?",
            answer: "Dental implants are artificial tooth roots made of titanium, surgically placed into the jawbone to support replacement teeth. They provide a stable foundation for crowns, bridges, or dentures."
        },
        {
            question: "Am I a suitable candidate for dental implants?",
            answer: "Most people with good oral and general health are candidates for dental implants. Your dentist will assess your specific case to determine eligibility."
        },
        {
            question: "Is the dental implant placement procedure painful?",
            answer: "The procedure is typically performed under local anaesthesia or sedation, so you should not feel significant pain during the surgery. Discomfort afterwards can usually be managed with over-the-counter pain medications."
        },
        {
            question: "How long does the entire dental implant process take?",
            answer: "The complete dental implant process, including healing and final restoration, can take several months. It may vary depending on individual factors and the need for additional procedures."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the success rate of dental implants?",
            answer: "Dental implants have a high success rate, often exceeding 95%. Success depends on factors such as oral hygiene, bone quality, and proper post-operative care."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I eat normally after getting dental implants?",
            answer: "Once the implants have integrated with the bone and the final restoration is in place, you can typically eat a normal diet without restrictions."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I care for and clean my dental implants?",
            answer: "Dental implants require regular oral hygiene practices, including brushing, flossing, and routine dental check-ups, just like natural teeth."
        },
        {
            question: "Are there any potential complications or risks associated with dental implants?",
            answer: "While complications are rare, they can include infection, implant failure, or complications during surgery. Discuss potential risks with your dentist before the procedure."
        },
        {
            question: "How long can I expect dental implants to last?",
            answer: "Dental implants can last a lifetime with proper care and maintenance. According to research around 95% of dental implants for single teeth survive at least 10 years making them a durable and long-term solution for missing teeth."
