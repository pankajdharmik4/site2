This stage identifies the optimal placement site and ensures your bone and gum tissue are ready for implants. Using this 3D imaging the dentist will then plan the surgery digitally and create a 3D printed template for use during the surgery."

This post acts as an artificial tooth root, providing a stable foundation for the replacement tooth. This process is painless after the local anaesthetic takes effect and post operative healing is usually more comfortable than patients were expecting."

        Dental implants are a transformative solution for restoring smiles and confidence, offering a durable and natural-looking replacement for missing or failing teeth as well as a replacement for loose dentures. The process requires the use of advanced technology and precision to ensure comfort, safety, and long-term success. Here's how the placement process unfolds:
